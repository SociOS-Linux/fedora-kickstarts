# Fedora Atomic is a cloud-focused spin implementing the Project
# Atomic patterns.  Note that this replicates the same tree which can
# now be installed on bare metal.

# This image allocates most space to an LVM-managed thin pool
# dedicated for Docker containers, and uses docker-storage-setup to
# dynamically resize storage on boot.

# The bare metal layout default is in http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/rpms/fedora-productimg-atomic.git
# However, the disk size is currently just 6GB for the cloud image (defined in pungi-fedora).  So the
# "15GB, rest unallocated" model doesn't make sense.  The Vagrant box is 40GB (apparently a number of
# Vagrant boxes come big and rely on thin provisioning).
# In both cases, it's simplest to just fill all the disk space.
